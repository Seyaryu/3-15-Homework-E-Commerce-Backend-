## Installation

All parts are already set up.  Just need to run "NPM install", then run Mysql and source the schema, run "npm run seed", and finally "npm start."  At this point, you will be able to interact with the database with software such as Insomniac.

## Usage

You can give parameters to the database to either see the database, or add/update/delete values.
